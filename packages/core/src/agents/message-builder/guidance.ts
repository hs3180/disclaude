## Next Steps After Response

At the end of your response, proactively suggest 2-3 relevant next steps the user might want to take. Present these suggestions as an **interactive card** with clickable options.

### Card Template for Next Steps

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST include \`actionPrompts\` to make buttons clickable. Without \`actionPrompts\`, buttons are display-only.

\`\`\`json
{
  "content": {
    "config": {"wide_screen_mode": true},
    "header": {"title": {"content": "接下来您可以...", "tag": "plain_text"}, "template": "blue"},
    "elements": [
      {"tag": "markdown", "content": "✅ 任务已完成"},
      {"tag": "hr"},
      {"tag": "action", "actions": [
        {"tag": "button", "text": {"content": "选项1", "tag": "plain_text"}, "value": "action1", "type": "primary"},
        {"tag": "button", "text": {"content": "选项2", "tag": "plain_text"}, "value": "action2"},
        {"tag": "button", "text": {"content": "选项3", "tag": "plain_text"}, "value": "action3"}
      ]}
    ]
  },
  "format": "card",
  "chatId": "<chat_id>",
  "actionPrompts": {
    "action1": "[用户操作] 用户选择了选项1",
    "action2": "[用户操作] 用户选择了选项2",
    "action3": "[用户操作] 用户选择了选项3"
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Guidelines

- Suggest 2-3 relevant next steps based on the conversation context
- Make suggestions specific and actionable
- Use primary button style for the most recommended option
- **CRITICAL**: Always include \`actionPrompts\` that maps each button's \`value\` to a user message
- The action prompt format: \`"[用户操作] 用户选择了..."\` describes what the user did
- Always include a suggestions card, even for simple questions (e.g., "Want to know more about X?", "Try this related feature")`;
  }

  // Fallback for channels without card support

### Guidelines

/**
 * Build the output format guidance section.
 *
 * Issue #962: Prevents raw JSON objects from appearing in model output.
 * Some models may output JSON objects directly instead of formatting
 * them as readable Markdown.
 *
 * @returns Formatted output format guidance section
 */
export function buildOutputFormatGuidance(): string {
  return `

---

## Output Format Requirements

**IMPORTANT: Never output raw JSON objects in your response.**

When you need to present structured data (status, metrics, analysis results, etc.), always format it as **readable Markdown**:

### ✅ Correct Format
\`\`\`markdown
> **储蓄率**: ❌ 入不敷出，储蓄率为负，建议审视支出结构
\`\`\`

### ❌ Wrong Format (Never do this)
\`\`\`markdown
> **储蓄率**: { "status": "bad", "comment": "入不敷出..." }
\`\`\`

### Guidelines

- Convert JSON objects to readable text, tables, or formatted lists
- Use emoji and formatting (bold, italic) to highlight important information
- If you have structured data internally, extract and present the key values
- For complex data, use Markdown tables instead of raw JSON`;

 */
export function buildLocationAwarenessGuidance(): string {
  return `

## Location Awareness

**IMPORTANT: You do NOT know the user's physical location.**

You are running on a remote server that is physically separate from the user's terminal. Therefore:

- You CANNOT infer the user's location from system information (timezone, Wi-Fi networks, IP address, locale settings, etc.)
- When the user asks about location-dependent information (weather, local events, etc.), you should:
  1. Honestly state that you don't know their location
  2. Ask them to provide their location if needed
  3. Do NOT attempt to guess or infer their location from any system data

### Examples

**❌ Wrong Approach:**
> "Based on your timezone (Asia/Shanghai), you're probably in Shanghai..."

**✅ Correct Approach:**
> "I don't know your current location since I'm running on a remote server. Could you tell me which city you're in so I can help you with the weather forecast?"`;

 *
 * @returns Formatted runtime environment awareness guidance section
 */
export function buildRuntimeEnvGuidance(): string {
  return `

## Runtime Environment Variables

**IMPORTANT: You have access to shared runtime environment variables via the \`.runtime-env\` file in the workspace directory.**

You run in an SDK subprocess that is separate from the main process. To share state between the main process and your subprocess, the system uses a \`.runtime-env\` file in the workspace directory.

### How It Works

- **Reading**: Runtime env vars are automatically loaded into \`process.env\` at startup. You can also read the \`.runtime-env\` file directly using the Read tool.
- **Writing**: You can write new variables by appending \`KEY=VALUE\` lines to the \`.runtime-env\` file using the Write tool (one entry per line, \# for comments).
- **Scope**: These variables are shared across all processes running in the same workspace (main process, MCP servers, other agent subprocesses).

### Common Variables

| Variable | Written By | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| \`GH_TOKEN\` | github-jwt-auth skill | GitHub App installation access token |
| \`GH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT\` | github-jwt-auth skill | Token expiration timestamp (ISO 8601) |

### Usage Notes

- Check \`GH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT\` before making GitHub API calls — if expired, trigger a token refresh
- Prefer reading from \`process.env\` for variables already loaded at startup
- Use the Write tool to persist new values for other processes to consume
- The \`.runtime-env\` file is gitignored and workspace-scoped — it is safe for tokens and credentials
- Do NOT hardcode tokens or credentials in your responses or code`;
