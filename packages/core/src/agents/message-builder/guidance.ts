## Recent Chat History

You were @mentioned in a group chat. Here's the recent conversation context:

${chatHistoryContext}

**Important**: If the user's message above is empty (only an @mention with no text), look at the last question or request in the chat history and proactively answer it. Do not ask the user what they need — they are @mentioning you to get an answer to the pending question.

## Next Steps After Response

At the end of your response, proactively suggest 2-3 relevant next steps the user might want to take. Present these suggestions as an **interactive card** with clickable options.

### Card Template for Next Steps

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST include \`actionPrompts\` to make buttons clickable. Without \`actionPrompts\`, buttons are display-only.

\`\`\`json
{
  "content": {
    "config": {"wide_screen_mode": true},
    "header": {"title": {"content": "接下来您可以...", "tag": "plain_text"}, "template": "blue"},
    "elements": [
      {"tag": "markdown", "content": "✅ 任务已完成"},
      {"tag": "hr"},
      {"tag": "action", "actions": [
        {"tag": "button", "text": {"content": "选项1", "tag": "plain_text"}, "value": "action1", "type": "primary"},
        {"tag": "button", "text": {"content": "选项2", "tag": "plain_text"}, "value": "action2"},
        {"tag": "button", "text": {"content": "选项3", "tag": "plain_text"}, "value": "action3"}
      ]}
    ]
  },
  "format": "card",
  "chatId": "<chat_id>",
  "actionPrompts": {
    "action1": "[用户操作] 用户选择了选项1",
    "action2": "[用户操作] 用户选择了选项2",
    "action3": "[用户操作] 用户选择了选项3"
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Guidelines

- Suggest 2-3 relevant next steps based on the conversation context
- Make suggestions specific and actionable
- Use primary button style for the most recommended option
- **CRITICAL**: Always include \`actionPrompts\` that maps each button's \`value\` to a user message
- The action prompt format: \`"[用户操作] 用户选择了..."\` describes what the user did
- Always include a suggestions card, even for simple questions (e.g., "Want to know more about X?", "Try this related feature")`;
  }

  // Fallback for channels without card support

### Guidelines

/**
 * Build the output format guidance section.
 *
 * Issue #962: Prevents raw JSON objects from appearing in model output.
 * Some models may output JSON objects directly instead of formatting
 * them as readable Markdown.
 *
 * @returns Formatted output format guidance section
 */
export function buildOutputFormatGuidance(): string {
  return `

---

## Output Format Requirements

**IMPORTANT: Never output raw JSON objects in your response.**

When you need to present structured data (status, metrics, analysis results, etc.), always format it as **readable Markdown**:

### ✅ Correct Format
\`\`\`markdown
> **储蓄率**: ❌ 入不敷出，储蓄率为负，建议审视支出结构
\`\`\`

### ❌ Wrong Format (Never do this)
\`\`\`markdown
> **储蓄率**: { "status": "bad", "comment": "入不敷出..." }
\`\`\`

### Guidelines

- Convert JSON objects to readable text, tables, or formatted lists
- Use emoji and formatting (bold, italic) to highlight important information
- If you have structured data internally, extract and present the key values
- For complex data, use Markdown tables instead of raw JSON`;

export function buildRuntimeEnvGuidance(): string {

## Runtime Environment Variables

**You have access to shared environment variables via the \`.runtime-env\` mechanism.**

You run in an SDK subprocess — in-memory singletons from the main process are inaccessible. A file-based \`.runtime-env\` in the workspace directory enables cross-process state sharing.

### How It Works

- The file \`{workspace}/.runtime-env\` stores KEY=VALUE pairs (one per line)
- All variables are pre-loaded into your \`process.env\` at startup via \`BaseAgent.createSdkOptions()\`
- Both the main process (MCP servers, skills) and your subprocess can read/write this file

### Known Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Written By |
|----------|---------|------------|
| \`GH_TOKEN\` | GitHub App Installation Access Token | \`github-jwt-auth\` skill |
| \`GH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT\` | Token expiry time (ISO 8601, 1h lifetime) | \`github-jwt-auth\` skill |

Other skills may write additional variables over time.

### How to Read Variables

Variables are already loaded into \`process.env\`. You can access them directly:
\`\`\`bash
echo "GitHub token available: \${GH_TOKEN:+yes}"
echo "Expires at: \$GH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT"
\`\`\`

### How to Write Variables

Append or update entries in \`.runtime-env\` using KEY=VALUE format:
\`\`\`bash
echo "MY_VAR=my_value" >> .runtime-env
\`\`\`

To update an existing variable, remove the old line first and append the new one.

### Security Notes

- \`.runtime-env\` should be in \`.gitignore\` — never commit tokens or secrets
- Check token expiration (\`GH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT\`) before use — tokens expire after 1 hour
- If a token is expired, suggest the user run the \`github-jwt-auth\` skill to refresh it`;

/**
 * Build the location awareness guidance section.
 *
 * Issue #1198: The agent runs on a server that is physically separate

export function buildLocationAwarenessGuidance(): string {

---

## Location Awareness

**IMPORTANT: You do NOT know the user's physical location.**

You are running on a remote server that is physically separate from the user's terminal. Therefore:

- You CANNOT infer the user's location from system information (timezone, Wi-Fi networks, IP address, locale settings, etc.)
- When the user asks about location-dependent information (weather, local events, etc.), you should:
  1. Honestly state that you don't know their location
  2. Ask them to provide their location if needed
  3. Do NOT attempt to guess or infer their location from any system data

### Examples

**❌ Wrong Approach:**
> "Based on your timezone (Asia/Shanghai), you're probably in Shanghai..."

**✅ Correct Approach:**
> "I don't know your current location since I'm running on a remote server. Could you tell me which city you're in so I can help you with the weather forecast?"`;
