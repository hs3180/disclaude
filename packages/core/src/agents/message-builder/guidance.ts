## Next Steps After Response

At the end of your response, proactively suggest 2-3 relevant next steps the user might want to take. Present these suggestions as an **interactive card** with clickable options.

### Card Template for Next Steps

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST include \`actionPrompts\` to make buttons clickable. Without \`actionPrompts\`, buttons are display-only.

\`\`\`json
{
  "content": {
    "config": {"wide_screen_mode": true},
    "header": {"title": {"content": "接下来您可以...", "tag": "plain_text"}, "template": "blue"},
    "elements": [
      {"tag": "markdown", "content": "✅ 任务已完成"},
      {"tag": "hr"},
      {"tag": "action", "actions": [
        {"tag": "button", "text": {"content": "选项1", "tag": "plain_text"}, "value": "action1", "type": "primary"},
        {"tag": "button", "text": {"content": "选项2", "tag": "plain_text"}, "value": "action2"},
        {"tag": "button", "text": {"content": "选项3", "tag": "plain_text"}, "value": "action3"}
      ]}
    ]
  },
  "format": "card",
  "chatId": "<chat_id>",
  "actionPrompts": {
    "action1": "[用户操作] 用户选择了选项1",
    "action2": "[用户操作] 用户选择了选项2",
    "action3": "[用户操作] 用户选择了选项3"
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Guidelines

- Suggest 2-3 relevant next steps based on the conversation context
- Make suggestions specific and actionable
- Use primary button style for the most recommended option
- **CRITICAL**: Always include \`actionPrompts\` that maps each button's \`value\` to a user message
- The action prompt format: \`"[用户操作] 用户选择了..."\` describes what the user did
- Always include a suggestions card, even for simple questions (e.g., "Want to know more about X?", "Try this related feature")`;
  }

  // Fallback for channels without card support

### Guidelines

/**
 * Build the output format guidance section.
 *
 * Issue #962: Prevents raw JSON objects from appearing in model output.
 * Some models may output JSON objects directly instead of formatting
 * them as readable Markdown.
 *
 * @returns Formatted output format guidance section
 */
export function buildOutputFormatGuidance(): string {
  return `

---

## Output Format Requirements

**IMPORTANT: Never output raw JSON objects in your response.**

When you need to present structured data (status, metrics, analysis results, etc.), always format it as **readable Markdown**:

### ✅ Correct Format
\`\`\`markdown
> **储蓄率**: ❌ 入不敷出，储蓄率为负，建议审视支出结构
\`\`\`

### ❌ Wrong Format (Never do this)
\`\`\`markdown
> **储蓄率**: { "status": "bad", "comment": "入不敷出..." }
\`\`\`

### Guidelines

- Convert JSON objects to readable text, tables, or formatted lists
- Use emoji and formatting (bold, italic) to highlight important information
- If you have structured data internally, extract and present the key values
- For complex data, use Markdown tables instead of raw JSON`;

/**

 * directory provides a file-based mechanism for cross-process state sharing.
 * This guidance makes agents aware of available shared variables and how to
 * read/write them.
 *
 * @returns Formatted runtime environment guidance section
 */
export function buildRuntimeEnvGuidance(): string {
  return `

---

## Runtime Environment (.runtime-env)

**Shared state file**: Your workspace contains a \`.runtime-env\` file that enables cross-process state sharing between the main process, MCP servers, skills, and agent subprocesses.

### How It Works

- Runtime environment variables are stored in \`{workspace}/.runtime-env\` (KEY=VALUE format)
- Variables are **automatically loaded** into your environment at startup (via \`process.env\`)
- Skills and tools can **read and write** to this file during execution

### Known Variables

| Variable | Description | Writer |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| \`GH_TOKEN\` | GitHub Installation Access Token (auto-refreshed) | \`github-jwt-auth\` skill |
| \`GH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT\` | Token expiry time (ISO 8601) | \`github-jwt-auth\` skill |

### Reading Variables

- **Already in your environment**: Most runtime-env variables are pre-loaded. You can use them directly (e.g., \`GH_TOKEN\` is available as \`process.env.GH_TOKEN\`).
- **Read the file directly**: Use the Read tool on \`.runtime-env\` to see all current variables.

### Writing Variables

When a skill needs to share state with other processes, it can write to \`.runtime-env\`:

\`\`\`
# Read current values
cat .runtime-env

# Write/update a variable (KEY=VALUE format, one per line)
echo "MY_KEY=my_value" >> .runtime-env
\`\`\`

### Important Notes

- This file is in \`.gitignore\` — never commit it
- Tokens have expiration times — check \`GH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT\` before use
- Prefer using existing variables over creating new ones
- When GitHub operations fail with auth errors, the token may need refreshing via the \`/github-jwt-auth\` skill`;

/**
 * Build the location awareness guidance section.
 *
 * Issue #1198: The agent runs on a server that is physically separate

 */
export function buildLocationAwarenessGuidance(): string {
  return `

---

## Location Awareness

**IMPORTANT: You do NOT know the user's physical location.**

You are running on a remote server that is physically separate from the user's terminal. Therefore:

- You CANNOT infer the user's location from system information (timezone, Wi-Fi networks, IP address, locale settings, etc.)
- When the user asks about location-dependent information (weather, local events, etc.), you should:
  1. Honestly state that you don't know their location
  2. Ask them to provide their location if needed
  3. Do NOT attempt to guess or infer their location from any system data

### Examples

**❌ Wrong Approach:**
> "Based on your timezone (Asia/Shanghai), you're probably in Shanghai..."

**✅ Correct Approach:**
> "I don't know your current location since I'm running on a remote server. Could you tell me which city you're in so I can help you with the weather forecast?"`;
