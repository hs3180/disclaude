description: Temporary chat lifecycle management - create, query, list, and respond to temporary chats. Primarily invoked by agents (PR Scanner, offline questions, etc.) to initiate user interactions. Use when user says keywords like "临时会话", "创建临时会话", "temporary chat", "/chat create", "发起讨论", "会话管理". Also supports direct user invocation via /chat create|query|list.

# Chat Manager

Manage temporary chats with a four-state lifecycle: **pending → active → expired / failed**.

Each chat is a JSON file in `workspace/chats/`. Chats are automatically activated (group created) by the companion Schedule (`chats-activation`).

## Single Responsibility

- ✅ Create chat files (pending state)
- ✅ Query chat status
- ✅ List chats with filters
- ✅ Handle user responses (update chat with response data)
- ❌ DO NOT create groups (Schedule handles this via lark-cli)
- ❌ DO NOT dissolve groups (handled by `chat-timeout` skill)
- ❌ DO NOT send messages to groups (handled by consumer skills)
- ❌ DO NOT execute callbacks or downstream actions

## Invocation Modes

### Mode 1: Agent Invocation (Primary)

Called by other agents/schedules that need to initiate a user interaction:

```
Agent → calls this Skill → creates pending chat file
```

No slash command needed; the agent invokes the Skill directly with chat parameters.

### Mode 2: Direct User Invocation

```
/chat create     — Create a new temporary chat
/chat query {id} — Query chat status
/chat list       — List all chats (optional --status filter)
```

## Context Variables

When invoked, you receive:
- **Chat ID**: Feishu chat ID (from "**Chat ID:** xxx")
- **Message ID**: Message ID (from "**Message ID:** xxx")
- **Sender Open ID**: Sender's open ID (from "**Sender Open ID:** xxx")

## Chat File Format

Each chat is a single JSON file in `workspace/chats/`:

```json
{
  "id": "pr-123",
  "status": "pending",
  "chatId": null,
  "createdAt": "2026-03-24T10:00:00Z",
  "activatedAt": null,
  "expiresAt": "2026-03-25T10:00:00Z",
  "expiredAt": null,
  "createGroup": {
    "name": "PR #123 Review",
    "members": ["ou_user1"]
  },
  "context": {"prNumber": 123},
  "response": null,
  "activationAttempts": 0,
  "lastActivationError": null,
  "failedAt": null
}
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Unique chat identifier (used as filename: `{id}.json`) |
| `status` | Yes | `pending` → `active` → `expired` / `failed` |
| `chatId` | No | Group chat ID (filled by Schedule after group creation) |
| `createdAt` | Yes | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `activatedAt` | No | ISO 8601 timestamp (filled by Schedule upon activation) |
| `expiresAt` | Yes | ISO 8601 UTC Z-suffix timestamp (e.g. `2026-03-25T10:00:00Z`) |
| `expiredAt` | No | ISO 8601 timestamp (set when marked as `expired` by Schedule) |
| `createGroup` | Yes | Group creation config with `name` and `members` array |
| `context` | No | Arbitrary key-value data for consumer use |
| `response` | No | User response data (filled when user responds in group) |
| `activationAttempts` | No | Retry counter for group creation (managed by Schedule, default: 0) |
| `lastActivationError` | No | Last error message from failed group creation (managed by Schedule) |
| `failedAt` | No | ISO 8601 timestamp (set when marked as `failed` by Schedule) |

### Response Format (after user interaction)

```json
{
  "response": {
    "content": "User's response text",
    "responder": "ou_developer",
    "repliedAt": "2026-03-24T14:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Operations

All scripts accept input via **environment variables** (avoids shell quoting issues with JSON) and are located in `skills/chat/`. All scripts include built-in Chat ID validation (path traversal protection), file locking (via `fs.flock`), and native JSON validation. Scripts are implemented in TypeScript and run via `tsx`.

### 1. Create Chat

**Usage**: `/chat create`

```bash
CHAT_ID="pr-123" \
CHAT_EXPIRES_AT="2026-03-25T10:00:00Z" \
CHAT_GROUP_NAME="PR #123 Review" \
CHAT_MEMBERS='["ou_developer"]' \
CHAT_CONTEXT='{"prNumber": 123}' \
npx tsx skills/chat/create.ts
```

**Validation** (built into script):
- `CHAT_ID` must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-][a-zA-Z0-9._-]*$` (no leading dots) and pass path traversal check
- `CHAT_EXPIRES_AT` must be UTC Z-suffix ISO 8601 format
- `CHAT_MEMBERS` must be a non-empty JSON array of `ou_xxxxx` open IDs
- Uniqueness checked under exclusive file lock (TOCTOU-safe)
- File written atomically via `writeFile` + `rename`

### 2. Query Chat

**Usage**: `/chat query {id}`

```bash
CHAT_ID="pr-123" npx tsx skills/chat/query.ts
```

Output is the raw JSON chat file. Display in readable format:

```
📋 Chat: pr-123
> **Status**: 🟡 Active (waiting for response)
> **Created**: 2026-03-24 10:00
> **Expires**: 2026-03-25 10:00
> **Group**: oc_xxx
> **Response**: None
```

### 3. List Chats

**Usage**: `/chat list [--status pending|active|expired|failed]`

```bash
# List all chats
npx tsx skills/chat/list.ts

# Filter by status
CHAT_STATUS="active" npx tsx skills/chat/list.ts
```

Display in table format:

```
📂 Temporary Chats

| ID | Status | Created | Expires | Response |
|----|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| pr-123 | 🟡 Active | 03-24 10:00 | 03-25 10:00 | - |
| deploy-456 | 🔴 Expired | 03-23 08:00 | 03-24 08:00 | approved |
| ask-789 | 🟢 Pending | 03-24 12:00 | 03-25 12:00 | - |
```

### 4. Handle Response

**Triggered by**: User responds in the group chat (natural conversation).

```bash
CHAT_ID="pr-123" \
CHAT_RESPONSE="Looks good, approve it" \
CHAT_RESPONDER="ou_developer" \
npx tsx skills/chat/response.ts
```

**Idempotency**: If a response already exists, the script rejects the write (prevents accidental overwrites).

**Note**: After updating the chat, the **consumer** (PR Scanner, offline questioner, etc.) is responsible for polling the chat file and taking downstream action. This skill does NOT execute callbacks.

## Lifecycle States

```
                    ┌──────────────┐
                    │              │
                    ▼              │
┌─────────────┐  Schedule     ┌─────────────┐
│   pending   │ ────────────>│   active    │
│  等待创建   │  (group       │  等待响应   │
└──────┬──────┘   created)    └──────┬──────┘
       │                             │
       │ 重试 ≥ 5 次                 │ timeout / response
       ▼                             ▼
┌──────────┐                  ┌──────────┐
│  failed  │                  │  expired │
│ 创建失败 │                  │  已结束   │
└──────────┘                  └──────────┘
```

| Status | Meaning | Trigger | Who Sets |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| `pending` | Waiting for group creation | Chat file created | **This Skill** |
| `active` | Group created, waiting for response | Schedule completes activation | **`chats-activation` Schedule** |
| `failed` | Group creation failed after max retries | Invalid members, API error, etc. | **`chats-activation` Schedule** |
| `expired` | Chat ended | User responded OR timeout | **Consumer** (response) / **`chat-timeout` Skill** (timeout) |

## Consumer Usage Pattern

Consumers (PR Scanner, offline questions, etc.) use this pattern:

```
1. Consumer calls this Skill → creates pending chat file
2. Schedule detects pending → creates group via lark-cli → sets active
   (or marks as failed after 5 retries if members are invalid)
3. Consumer detects chat is active (polls chat file) → sends message to group
4. User responds in group → consumer/skill updates chat file with response
5. chat-timeout Skill detects timeout → marks as expired, dissolves group
6. Consumer polls chat file → finds response → takes downstream action
```

## Chat Directory

```
workspace/chats/
├── pr-123.json              # PR review chat
├── offline-deploy-456.json  # Offline question chat
└── ask-review-789.json      # Agent ask_user chat
```

## DO NOT

- ❌ Create or dissolve groups (Schedule creates, `chat-timeout` skill dissolves)
- ❌ Send messages to groups (consumer skill's responsibility)
- ❌ Execute downstream actions based on responses (consumer's responsibility)
- ❌ Modify chats created by other processes
- ❌ Create chats without a valid `expiresAt` (must be UTC Z-suffix)
- ❌ Use YAML format (always JSON)
- ❌ Delete chat files manually
- ❌ Manually delete `.lock` files (cleaned up by `chats-cleanup` schedule)

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Chat file not found | Report "Chat {id} not found" |
| Chat already expired | Report "Chat {id} already expired, cannot update" |
| Chat status is `failed` | Report "Chat {id} failed to activate: {lastActivationError}" |
| Invalid JSON in chat file | Report error, do not overwrite |
| Duplicate `id` | Report "Chat {id} already exists" |
| Invalid chat ID (path traversal) | Report "Invalid chat ID" and reject immediately |
| Duplicate response | Report "Chat {id} already has a response" and reject |
| Node.js not available | Exit with error (required runtime, v20.12+ for file locking) |
| File locking unavailable | No-op fallback with warning (requires Node 20.12+) |

## Example: PR Review Chat

### Agent Creates Chat

```bash
CHAT_ID="pr-123" \
CHAT_EXPIRES_AT="2026-03-24T22:00:00Z" \
CHAT_GROUP_NAME="PR #123: Fix auth bug" \
CHAT_MEMBERS='["ou_developer"]' \
CHAT_CONTEXT='{"prNumber": 123, "repository": "hs3180/disclaude"}' \
npx tsx skills/chat/create.ts
```

### Schedule Activates (automatic)

`chats-activation` Schedule reads the pending chat, creates group via `lark-cli`, updates status to `active`.

### User Responds

User replies in the group naturally (types text). Consumer or this skill updates the chat file with the response.

### PR Scanner Polls

PR Scanner reads `pr-123.json`, finds `response` with user's decision, executes `gh pr merge 123`.

## Discussion Focus Mode

Issue #1228: Temporary chats can operate in **discussion focus mode**, where the agent stays anchored to the original discussion topic.

### How It Works

When a chat is created with a `discussionTopic` in the context, the consuming agent should pass it to `MessageBuilder` via the `discussionTopic` field on `MessageData`. The MessageBuilder will inject a discussion-focus guidance section that:

1. **Anchors** the agent to the original question
2. **Detects drift** and gently redirects conversation back
3. **Summarizes** progress periodically

### Example: Discussion Chat

```bash
CHAT_ID="discuss-456" \
CHAT_EXPIRES_AT="2026-04-26T10:00:00Z" \
CHAT_GROUP_NAME="Discuss: Code formatting" \
CHAT_MEMBERS='["ou_developer"]' \
CHAT_CONTEXT='{"discussionTopic": "Should we automate code formatting?", "source": "start-discussion"}' \
npx tsx skills/chat/create.ts
```

### Integration for Consumers

When reading an active discussion chat, extract the topic from context:

```typescript
const chat = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('workspace/chats/discuss-456.json', 'utf-8'));
const discussionTopic = chat.context?.discussionTopic;

// Pass to MessageBuilder
const enhancedContent = messageBuilder.buildEnhancedContent({
  text: userInput,
  messageId: 'msg-123',
  discussionTopic,
}, chatId);
```

### Discussion Personality Source

The discussion personality content is defined in `skills/chat/discussion-soul.md` and implemented as `buildDiscussionFocusGuidance()` in the core MessageBuilder.
